## Tensorflow BDRW

Loading and training the on BDRW dataset. Fileloader made in Tensorflow, no need to load the dataset in the TFRecords or other binary formats.

There is a standard Tensorflow implementation and one that uses Keras combined with Tensorflow. MNIST is used for testing (using the MNIST functions included in Tensorflow) but can easily be switched to BDRW.
